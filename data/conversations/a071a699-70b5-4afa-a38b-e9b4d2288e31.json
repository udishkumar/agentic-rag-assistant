      "assistant": "Based on the information from both the document context and web search results, I can provide you with a recipe for a chocolate shake. I'll combine elements from both sources to give you a comprehensive answer.\n\nFrom the document context, we have a recipe for a Chocolate Banana Breakfast Shake, which can be adapted to make a chocolate shake:\n\nIngredients:\n1 cup skim or 1% milk\n1 serving of chocolate powder (such as Carnation Instant Breakfast, Ovaltine, or chocolate protein powder)\n\u00bd banana (optional, for added flavor and creaminess)\n\u00bc cup dry oats (optional, for added texture and nutrition)\nSmall handful of nuts (optional, such as walnuts, almonds, or pecans for added flavor and nutrition)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Put all ingredients in a blender.\n2. Blend until smooth (it may remain slightly lumpy if using oats and nuts).\n\nNow, incorporating information from the web search results, we can modify and expand on this recipe to make a more traditional chocolate milkshake:\n\nIngredients:\n2-3 scoops chocolate ice cream\n1/2 to 1 cup milk (adjust for desired thickness)\n2-3 tablespoons chocolate syrup\n1 tablespoon cocoa powder (optional, for extra chocolate flavor)\nWhipped cream (optional, for topping)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Add ice cream, milk, chocolate syrup, and cocoa powder (if using) to a blender.\n2. Blend until smooth and creamy. If the shake is too thick, add more milk; if it's too thin, add more ice cream.\n3. Pour into a glass and top with whipped cream if desired.\n\nAdditional tips:\n- For a thicker shake, use less milk or add some ice cubes.\n- You can use chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla for an even more intense chocolate flavor.\n- If you want to make it healthier, you can incorporate elements from the breakfast shake recipe, such as adding a banana or using a chocolate protein powder instead of syrup.\n- For a dairy-free version, you can use non-dairy milk and ice cream alternatives.\n\nThis recipe combines the simplicity of the document's breakfast shake with the more indulgent elements of a traditional chocolate milkshake from the web search results, giving you flexibility to adjust based on your preferences.",
